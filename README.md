# Cats_or_dogs

This Notebook involves the complete workflow of building and fine-tuning a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. It includes loading and preparing the data, consisting of Â±5000 images of cats and dogs. The workflow consists of experimenting with different network architectures by adjusting layers and pooling strategies, and exploring the advantages of transfer learning and data augmentation. The workflow also covers saving and loading trained models for reuse and concludes with submitting test images of cats and dogs to the model, having it determine whether the image is of a cat or a dog.

Due to the high computational demands of processing and training the model on thousands of image data, this Notebook is best run in Google Colab.
